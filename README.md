Hi, my name is Taylor and I am a computer science major at Kennesaw State University. In addition to my studies, I am also the owner of an auto detailing business in Atlanta, Georgia. My interests in computer science include creating applications and constantly learning more about the field.
Outside of school and work, I have a passion for time attack racing and street drifting. These hobbies allow me to combine my love of cars and technology, and I enjoy pushing myself to improve my skills on the track.
Overall, I am a driven and motivated individual with a diverse range of interests. I am committed to excelling in my studies and business, and I am always looking for ways to grow and learn more.
